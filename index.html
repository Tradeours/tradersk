      <h2 class="trig">Who am I?</h2>
      <p>
       Hi there, my name is Sreekrishnan K (B.Com CA, MCA). I am originally from Kerala and have a strong interest in both finance and technology. With over six years of experience in the market, I have developed expertise as a swing trader, with a focus on this type of trade comprising approximately 90% of my portfolio.

      <h2 class="trig">Why Swing Trade?</h2>
      <p>
      I was a bank nifty option scalper a few years back. I used to punch min 100+ orders per day. I usually look for per day profits. But due to the excess screen time and the intricacy of the setup, I couldn't able to focus on any other stuffs. Not able to spend time with my parents & friends, my health deteriorated and I literally didn't have a meaningful life. (It was due to my own psychological issue).

So I decided to get out from this trading style and decided to do <span class="tag">Swing Trading</span>... <b>The ideology was to form a trading setup that is absolutely effective and less complex.</b> I experimented a lot and finally discovered a trading setup that <span class="tag">suits my personality.</span>

      <p>All you need to have is a little <span class="tag">patience</span> and the ability to sit simply for a couple of days.<br><br>

Note: This doesn’t mean that this setup is 100 % accurate and you can become a millionaire soon… Any wise person knows that there is no such thing as a 100 % accurate setup.<br>


<span class="tag">We should think in terms of probabilities.</span>  If we are taking 10 trades and if we win big on 6 or 7 trades and we lose small on 4 or 3 trades, then it is a high probable setup.<span class="tag"> My setup is a highly probable one.</span><br>
Don’t waste your time looking for sure short and 100 % accurate setups because it doesn’t exist. Always look for high probable setups.</p>

      <p>  The duration of the course will be around 2 hours. I am charging for the simplicity and effectiveness of my technique, not for the class duration. Since it’s purely a damn straightforward setup, you can definitely understand within a short period of time. The session can be extended if you are having on-going queries. But remember to practice it in the live market for at least 6 months. I will provide support after the session. You can ping me for any doubts.

I won't be blabbing stuff like How to identify candlestick patterns, Harmonics, how to use Fib retracement etc. You can get the generic stuffs freely from YouTube.</p>

      <h1 class="trig">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
	  <h2 class="trig">1. "Swing trading with less efforts” is it a clickbait?</h2>
      <p>
      No. The most important aspect of trading isn't really when you buy or sell, but what you do before, during, and after. As a Trader, you need to have the skill to sit and do nothing. What happens to the price of the scrip you are trading, isn't in your control, but how you react is. During my class, you will come to understand the significance of this technique and how it can revolutionize your approach to trading. This a simple yet unique method that you won't find anywhere else.

    <div class="container">
	  <h2 class="trig">3. Does my strategy works on all the Scripts/Segments?</h2>
      <p>
   My trading setup works only on a particular script. There is a reason why I am trading on this script all the time with this strategy. My intention is to make money from the market, not to trade on different different scripts. So it doesn't matter if you trade on 100 scrips or 1 scrip - all it matters is that are you making money from the market?

  <section>
    <div class="container">
	  <h2 class="trig">4. How accurate is the strategy ?</h2>
      <p>
     Our system caught 20 trade entries for the past 2 year. 14 succeeded 3 got failed and 3 went into cost to cost. I will show you this data in the session. High Probability setup works in such a way that whenever you win you win BIG. Whenever you lose you lose small. It's not about how many times you win, It's all about how big you win.

	  <h2 class="trig">5. What you will learn?</h2>
      <p>
     I am offering a technique that is both simple and effective for making money in the stock market with minimal effort. The technique involves allowing a trade to run for a few days without interference, which will result in a significant financial gain.

	  <h2 class="trig">6. I don’t know anything about the market. I am an absolute beginner. Shall I attend the session?</h2>
      <p>
     This is not a course about basic introduction to the stock market, the NSE, BSE, Candlestick patterns , or technical analysis, etc. You should have the very basic knowledge about the market. It is enough to know how to buy, sell, what is up- and downtrend, how to open a chart etc. You know, the basic concepts…

    <div class="container">
	  <h2 class="trig">7. Can office goers, students or homemakers join this course?</h2>
      <p>
     Yes. To make money in the stock market with my setup, you don't need to spend a lot of time analyzing charts or searching for patterns. Instead, you can simply spend a few minutes before entering a trade. If you win, your profit percentage will be large, and if you lose, your loss percentage will be small. Try this technique 10 times and see the results for yourself. Rather than constantly staring at the screen, you can make money simply by being patient.<br>

	I don't stare at my screen all the time in search of patterns, stock selection, scanners etc. I make money by sitting simply. ie; with Patience!

  <section>
    <div class="container">
	  <h2 class="trig">12. How much trades can I make and what about the ROI?</h2>
      <p>
     Our method involves taking 1-3 trades per month on an average, with the potential for more than a 15-20% profit on the profitable side, using a 1:2 risk-reward ratio or higher. We will also experience losses as this method is not a god’s strategy or foolproof strategy but the number of loss occurrences will be minimal as compared to the profits. During our session, I will discuss where to place stop-loss orders, how much risk to take per trade, and proper money and risk management techniques. The focus is on generating a high return on investment, rather than taking a large number of trades.”
